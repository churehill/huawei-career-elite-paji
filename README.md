# huawei-career-elite-paji

I and my teamate particated in 2015 Huawei Career Elite Challenge Competition, and our team name called "paji". It's a Texas hold'em Poker bot competition, each team submit a poker bot program, and bots compete with each other. The bot which live longest in the poker game and earn most money win the game.

We decided to use Python to write the code, because Python is handy to handle socket and parse communication message. And we used open source library [pokerhand-eval](https://github.com/aliang/pokerhand-eval) and [pypoker-eval](https://github.com/minmax/pypoker-eval), and they helped a lot.

Our poker bot paji passed the preliminary and entered semifinal, but we failed to get into the last 8th.

Hope these code may be useful for someone.  ^O^
